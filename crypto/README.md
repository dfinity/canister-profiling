# Cryptographic libraries

Measure different cryptographic libraries written in both Motoko and Rust.

* SHA-2 benchmarks
  + `SHA-256/SHA-512`. Compute the hash of a 1M Wasm binary.
  + `account_id`. Compute the ledger account id from principal, based on SHA-224.
  + `neuron_id`. Compute the NNS neuron id from principal, based on SHA-256.
* Certified map. Merkle Tree for storing key-value pairs and generate witness according to the IC Interface Specification.
  + `generate 10k`. Insert 10k 7-character word as both key and value into the certified map.
  + `max mem`. For Motoko, it reports `rts_max_heap_size` after `generate` call; For Rust, it reports the Wasm's memory page * 32Kb.
  + `inc`. Increment a counter and insert the counter value into the map.
  + `witness`. Generate the root hash and a witness for the counter.
