# Heartbeat / Timer

Measure the cost of empty heartbeat and timer job.

* `setTimer` measures both the `setTimer(0)` method and the execution of empty job.
* It is not easy to reliably capture the above events in one flamegraph, as the implementation detail
of the replica can affect how we measure this. Typically, a correct flamegraph contains both `setTimer` and `canister_global_timer` function. If it's not there, we may need to adjust the script.
